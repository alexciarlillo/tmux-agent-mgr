//! Claude Code's hook interface, mapped onto our pane options.
//!
//! [`HOOK_REGISTRATIONS`] is the single source of truth for which triggers we ask
//! for. It is checked against the shipped `hooks/hooks.json` — the file Claude Code
//! actually reads — by [`tests::hooks_json_matches_the_registration_table`], because
//! nothing else connects the two: one is Rust, the other is JSON read by another
//! program entirely.
//!
//! Field names below come from the hooks reference at
//! <https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks>. Where a payload might carry either an
//! old or a new spelling we read both, and an unrecognized value degrades to "say
//! nothing" rather than to a guess — passive detection is still running underneath
//! and is the better answer than a confident wrong one.
//!
//! ## The subagent gate
//!
//! Subagents inherit the parent's `$TMUX_PANE` and fire their own lifecycle hooks
//! through it, so while any subagent is live we cannot tell a parent's event from
//! a child's. The rule that follows from that: **accept only the assertions that
//! stay true whichever of them sent it.**
//!
//! - "There is work in progress" and "somebody needs you" hold either way. A
//!   child running means the pane is running; a child's permission prompt is
//!   still the user's to answer, and it appears in the same terminal. So
//!   `UserPromptSubmit`, `PermissionDenied` and a blocking `Notification` always
//!   apply.
//! - "The turn is over", "it failed" and "the session is gone" do not. A
//!   subagent's `Stop` would park a busy pane at idle mid-turn. So `SessionStart`,
//!   `SessionEnd`, `Stop`, `StopFailure` and an `idle_prompt` notification are
//!   dropped until [`tmux::PANE_SUBAGENTS`] drains.
//!
//! Subagent and task events are keyed by id or are pure counters, so they always
//! apply — `SubagentStop` in particular must, or the list could never drain.
//!
//! The residual failure is a subagent that dies without its `SubagentStop`: the
//! pane then keeps reporting running/blocked but stops reporting "done" until the
//! daemon's 15-minute hook-staleness fallback hands the pane back to passive
//! detection, or its liveness sweep clears the pane outright. Both are far better
//! than a live pane wiped by a child's event.
