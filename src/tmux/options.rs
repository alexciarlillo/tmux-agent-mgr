//! Single source of truth for every tmux option this plugin reads or writes.
//!
//! Three groups, and the split matters:
//!
//! 1. **Daemon-owned pane options** — the *resolved* status. The daemon is the
//!    only writer; everything else reads. This is what makes N open sidebars
//!    cost one poller instead of N.
//! 2. **Hook-owned pane options** — raw facts pushed by the agent. Hooks never
//!    write resolved state; the daemon reconciles these with passive detection
//!    and owns the liveness sweep that clears them when the agent process is
//!    gone (see [`crate::daemon`]).
//! 3. **User configuration** — read-only from our side, seeded with defaults by
//!    `agent-mgr.conf`.
//!
//! Keeping the two pane namespaces separate is what makes precedence explicit
//! and lets a stale hook write be cleaned up without disturbing passive state.
