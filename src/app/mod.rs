//! The event loop, and the state it drives.
//!
//! # Why this loop looks the way it does
//!
//! The plugin this one replaces flickered, and the cause was its redraw policy:
//! it called `terminal.draw()` on a 50 ms timer whether or not anything had
//! changed, and forced a full `terminal.clear()` every 500 ms. Inside a tmux
//! overlay that means recompositing the region twice a second, forever, even
//! with nobody watching.
//!
//! So this loop holds three rules:
//!
//! 1. **Draw only when the visible output actually changed.** Rendering is pure
//!    ([`crate::ui::rows`]), so each pass builds the lines, hashes their text,
//!    and draws only on a different hash. Not "state changed" — *output* changed.
//! 2. **Never clear on a timer.** The one `terminal.clear()` in this crate is in
//!    the resize arm, where the terminal's own geometry changed under us.
//! 3. **Animate only when there is something to animate.** The spinner clock
//!    advances only while a pane is Working. With nothing running, successive
//!    passes produce byte-identical lines, the hash never moves, and the terminal
//!    receives nothing at all.
//!
//! The result: an idle sidebar left open for an hour writes zero bytes to the
//! terminal. Set `AGENT_MGR_DEBUG_FRAMES=<path>` to have the draw count written
//! there on exit and check it yourself.
