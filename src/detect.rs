//! Passive agent detection: recognizing an agent by its process name, and
//! inferring what it is doing from the pane title and the visible screen.
//!
//! This is the zero-setup path — nothing is wrapped, shimmed, or launched by us,
//! and no hook needs to be installed. The cost is that it reads the agents' UI,
//! so it is **heuristic and version-sensitive**: a Claude or Codex redesign, an
//! unusual theme, or a non-English locale can throw off a reading. When the
//! agent's own hooks are wired up, [`crate::daemon`] prefers those instead.
//!
//! Ported from `tmux-agent-switcher`'s `src/detect.rs`, which is where these
//! heuristics (and their edge cases) were worked out.
